Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Note 2 – Revenue
Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 were as follows (in millions):
Total net sales include $3.4 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June 29, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of March 30, 2024, $3.3 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of April 1, 2023, $6.5 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended June 29, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, and $7.0 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022.
The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.
As of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of June 29, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.

Note 3 – Earnings Per Share
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):
Approximately 32 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended July 1, 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.
Note 4 – Financial Instruments
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in millions):

(1)The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
(2)As of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $14.1 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 6, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.
The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of June 29, 2024 (in millions):
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 29, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.
The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Apple Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 8
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):
The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):
Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 41% of total trade receivables as of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.
Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 46% and 18%. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

Note 6 – Income Taxes
European Commission State Aid Decision
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission (the “Commission”) announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.
Note 7 – Debt
Commercial Paper
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

Share Repurchase Program
During the nine months ended June 29, 2024, the Company repurchased 387 million shares of its common stock for $70.0 billion. The Company’s share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:
•iPad Air®;
•iPad Pro®;
•iOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.
The Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be available on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, macOS Sequoia and iPadOS 18.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June 29, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Digital Markets Act Investigations
On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.
Department of Justice Lawsuit
On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.
Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.
Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2024 (the “second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q”), in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except for the risk factor disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of the second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K.
